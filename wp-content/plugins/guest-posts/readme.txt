Give an opportunity to your unregistered readers to post on your Blog.


== Description ==
Offer your blog guests or unregistered blog readers an opportunity to post on your WordPress blog without registering themselves.<br>
<strong>Guest Posts</strong> will help you to create a strong interaction and engagement with your blog readers.

This plugin will create a form where your guests can submit their posts.<br>
The posts will be saved directly into your WordPress database and will show up in your WordPress Dashboard as pending.<br>
You can then review and approve them as needed.

It will save authors Name and email as custom field, so you will be able to display authors name and give them a credit back with some simple 
tweaks into your theme.

You can also show a custom Thank You message after submitting the post.

The plugin is simple to install and use. Even a very novice user can install and use the plugin. And I'm sure you are better than that. ;)<br>
No need to edit any code.<br>
For a easy installation guide checkout the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/guest-posts/installation/"><strong>Installation</strong></a> tab above.

You can style the form if you wish. We have used just one class called "guest-posts". To style the form add CSS for the "guest-posts" class 
and it's sub elements into your theme.

<strong>Version 2.0, Now loaded with more features.</strong>

<strong>Upcoming Features</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Captcha validation</li>
</ul>

== Installation ==

You will be ready to offer a very new and unique feature to your readers within 2 minutes with our very easy installation recipe.

<ul>
	<li>From your WordPress Dashboard Go for a "Add New" inside "Plugins" menu.</li>
	<li>Search for "Guest Posts" and install the plugin.</li>
	<li>Activate the plugin</li>
</ul>
<strong>You:</strong> Oh God, 35 seconds gone and still I'm not done. What will I do now!!!!?<br>
<strong>Me:</strong> Don't worry my boy, I'm here for you. Just follow me.
<ul>
	<li>Create a new page called "Guest Posts" or whatever you like.</li>
	<li>Paste this shortcode into the page and save it: [guest-posts]</li>
</ul>

<strong>You:</strong> Is it really so simple? I still have 35 seconds left. What can I do at this time?<br>
<strong>Me:</strong> Yes it's so simple. You may leave a review with 5 star feedback in this time. :)

Check out our new admin panel from <strong>Dashboard > Settings > Guest Posts</strong> for various post options.

Optionally you can create a custom Thank you page and set it via thanks attribute. Example: [guest-posts 
thanks="http://yoursite.com/thanks"]<br>
By default it will take your gusts to the home page after submitting the post.


You can also preset guest posts account by adding author ID to author attribute like: [guest-posts author=5]<br>
By default it will save posts for author ID 1.


Now translation ready.
